# Teddy ðŸ§¸

Blazing fast key value in-memory database built in rust.

Yes, Redis is amazing, but I have created Teddy as a modern day alternative.

## Overview

The project is a cargo workspace and has 2 members currently -
1. **teddy-rs**: the crate containing the core functionality of Teddy
2. **teddy-shell**: the crate containing a REPL for Teddy

### NOTE: Project under development
